# Geshan Public Speaking

A timeline of most of my public speaking done for tech conferences and meetups. All my talks are in English. 

I am open to speaking offers, mainly in Sydney, Australia. The best way to reach me is by 
[email](mailto:geshan@gmail.com?subject=Interested%20for%20a%20talk%3F), thanks!.

Inspired by other public-speaking repos like [these](https://github.com/ahmetb/public-speaking)

* A longer (but less organized) list is available on by [blog](https://geshan.com.np/blog/categories/talks/) with 
talks from as early as [2010](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2010/08/drupal-non-technical-introduction-at/).
