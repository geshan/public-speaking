# Geshan Public Speaking

A timeline of most of my public speaking done for tech conferences and meetups. All my talks are in English. 

I am open to speaking offers, mainly in Sydney, Australia. The best way to reach me is by

* I have not included some talks done internally for places I work or worked for and when I spoke at colleges 
in Kathmandu, Nepal. 
* A longer (but less organized) list is available on by [blog](https://geshan.com.np/blog/categories/talks/) with 
talks from as early as [2010](https://geshan.com.np/blog/2010/08/drupal-non-technical-introduction-at/).
* You can go to this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I1MK3lNZPI&list=PLhTqkNYfkucwyaMujDSSPkqQj5uTO9alh&index=1)
which has 8 of my talks.
